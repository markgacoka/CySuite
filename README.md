# CySuite
CySuite is a web security automation tool designed to ease recon and vulnerability assessment in web targets. This tool is suited for bug bounty hunters, penetration testers and cybersecurity enthusiasts with interest in security automation. 

CySuite is designed to scan and test for all classic vulnerabilities in the OWASP Top 10 list. It starts with passive and active reconnaissance, stores the result to a database, then scans for attack vectors in which a potential vulnerability might lie. 

CySuite also offers a myriad of tools for vulnerability assessment such as a request manipulator, a wordlist generator, a code injector and various encoders/decoders.
